# GCC C Torture Suite

This directory contains a checkout of
svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk/gcc/testsuite/gcc.c-torture/execute .

Last checked at SVN version 275024

CMake Build configuration added by the LLVM project. The tests in
`execute/builtins` are not run, and each CMakeLists.txt contains a list of tests
to skip. These are both general and architecture-specific.

# Platform-specific concerns:

RISC-V: The list of tests to exclude on RISC-V was devised using glibc and qemu.
You may have to exclude additional tests when running with newlib and/or spike.
