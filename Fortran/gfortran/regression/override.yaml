# Overrides for DejaGNU annotations for tests in the directory in which this
# file is present. To override tests in subdirectories, create/edit an
# override.yaml file in that subdirectory.
#
# Please see gfortran/README.md for instructions on editing this file.
#
# This file is broadly divided into two. The first section contains tests that
# are "temporarily "overridden. This are usually tests that fail on certain 
# platforms, but pass on others, but are intended to pass everywhere. When the
# underlying issue is addressed, the tests should be removed. Eventually, there
# should be no tests at all in this section. The second section contains tests
# that are "permanently" overridden - usually because flang's behavior deviates
# from gfortran, but we want the tests to run anyway.
#
# When adding a test to this file, please leave a comment describing why the
# behavior of the test is being overridden.
