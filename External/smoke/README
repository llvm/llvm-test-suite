This directory contains a CMakeLists.txt for the aomp benchmark with 
the smoke test that is built as part of the LLVM test-suite.
Its sources are not part of the test-suite but
have to be fetched separately from https://github.com/ROCm/aomp

The CMakeLists.txt contains internal greenlists and redlists that the user
must declare which options to use with SYSTEM_GPU. The user is able to
declare multiple lists to use.

here are all of the options:
-amd (this is the greenlist that contains tests that passes)
-amd_runtime_redlist
-amd_compiler_redlist
-amd_redlist(this is the combination of both runtime and compiler redlists)
-nvidia (this is the greenlist that contains tests that passes)
-nvidia_runtime_redlist
-nvidia_compiler_redlist
-nvidia_redlist(this is the combination of both runtime and compiler redlists)
-intel (this is the greenlist that contains tests that passes)
-intel_runtime_redlist
-intel_compiler_redlist
-intel_redlist(this is the combination of both runtime and compiler redlists)

An example run is:

$ cmake ../llvm-test-suite \
  -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release           \
  -DTEST_SUITE_SMOKE_ROOT=${HOME}/src/aomp                    \
  -DTEST_SUITE_LIT=${HOME}/build/llvm-project/release/bin/llvm-lit      \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${HOME}/install/llvm-project/release/bin/clang     \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${HOME}/install/llvm-project/release/bin/clang++ \
  -DTEST_SUITE_SUBDIRS=External/smoke                              \
  -DTEST_SUITE_OFFLOADING_CFLAGS=--offload-arch=native \
  -DTEST_SUITE_OFFLOADING_LDFLAGS=--offload-arch=native;-lopenmptarget \
  -DSYSTEM_GPU="amd\;amd_runtime_redlist" \
  -DTEST_SUITE_LIT_FLAGS=-svj1
